# Discrete Fourier Transform Algorithms
An educational repository on FFT and related algorithms. 

### What is a Discrete Fourier Transform?

TODO
- Refresh continuum FT
- Introduce DFT matrix
  - Intro to assumptions about discrete signal (periodicity?)

### Cooley Tukey Algorithms

- Radix-2 Cooley Tukey Desimation In Time. 
- Zero padding
- Optimizations

### LAPACK

Lapack is a highly optimized FORTRAN package. 
- How is FFT implemented in LAPACK?
