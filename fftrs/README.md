- [x] Figure out how if there is a native complex integer datatype in rust


Building the FFT
- [x] Make your own complex data type
- [x] Initiate array of 8 complex numbers (just a boring one)
- [x] Implement the inplace FFT algorithm on them, RADIX 2 DIT CT with an array of length 8 )(i.e. three stages)
  - [x] Init second array of 8 complex numbers for flip-flopping purposes
  - [x] Static SINE function to use in FFT
  
- [ ] modify complex struct so that it stores a maximum amount of bits
- [ ] modify SINE function so that it sores correct number of bits
